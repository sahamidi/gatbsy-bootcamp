                Hey!! to make this easy lets call me Sal, or if we become 
                good friends you can call me YourPalSal.  I am a career driven,
                entreprenueristic looking to make a major change in my career to 
                software development and database management.  Why both?  Because
                specialization is for insects.  Just kidding.  I want career exposure to
                both as I would like to be well in all aspects of development of web and 
                applications.
